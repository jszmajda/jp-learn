# jp-learn: A System-First Japanese Learning Framework

A personalized Japanese language learning system that treats language as an interconnected system rather than isolated vocabulary. Built for learners who need to understand the complete architecture before diving into details.

## What Makes This Different

Traditional language learning apps make you memorize "rectangles" - static flashcards that you recognize by their visual pattern rather than understanding their meaning. This system generates **dynamic contexts** every time, forcing genuine comprehension over pattern memorization.

## Core Philosophy

- **System-First**: Understand the complete Japanese language architecture before learning individual pieces
- **Pattern Discovery**: Derive rules from examples rather than memorizing grammar tables
- **Pressure-Activated Learning**: Crisis scenarios and time pressure for peak performance
- **Production vs Recognition**: Tracks these as separate skills (research shows they are)
- **The "Why" Matters**: Every pattern explained with etymology, logic, and cultural context

## System Components

### üìê `system-overview.md`
Complete Japanese language architecture in 12 sections. Master the system framework first, then fill in vocabulary.

### üéØ `CLAUDE.md` 
Teaching framework for Claude AI to function as a dynamic Japanese tutor. Includes:
- Pressure scenarios (medical emergencies, airport crises, technical problems)
- Pattern discovery exercises
- Deep dive options for exhaustive concept mastery
- Metacognitive prompts for learning optimization

### üìä `vocabulary.json`
Comprehensive tracking system with:
- Separate production vs recognition levels
- Error pattern analysis for L1 interference
- Analytics dashboard with learning metrics
- Burnout prevention monitoring

### üó∫Ô∏è `learning-objectives.md`
18-month pathway to N2 (professional) Japanese proficiency with:
- Crisis scenario progressions
- Pattern mastery milestones
- Sprint learning sessions for burst study

### üìù `progress-notes.md`
Session summaries and learning insights tracking.

## Target Learner Profile

This system is optimized for learners who:
- Need to understand the complete system before learning details
- Perform best under pressure rather than relaxed practice
- Prefer intensive burst sessions over daily minimums
- Want to know WHY language rules exist
- Think in patterns and systems rather than memorizing lists
- Track progress through data and metrics

## Key Features

- **No Static Flashcards**: Every context is dynamically generated
- **System Mastery**: Complete verb conjugation matrix, particle logic tree, formality architecture
- **Crisis Training**: Airport emergencies, medical situations, business deadlines
- **Pattern-Based**: Discover rules through examples, not memorization
- **Dual Tracking**: Recognition and production tracked as separate skills
- **L1 Interference Prevention**: Proactive English-speaker error pattern identification

## Learning Approach

1. **Master the Framework** - Understand how Japanese works as a complete system
2. **Discover Patterns** - Derive rules from examples using pattern recognition
3. **Pressure Practice** - Use crisis scenarios to activate peak performance
4. **Track Everything** - Monitor both recognition and production accuracy
5. **Deep Dive When Ready** - Exhaustively master any concept that interests you

## Requirements

- Claude AI (claude.ai) for interactive tutoring
- Text editor for file updates
- No audio dependencies (system is text-based)

## Getting Started

1. Read `system-overview.md` to understand the complete Japanese language architecture
2. Review `learning-objectives.md` to understand the learning pathway
3. Open `CLAUDE.md` with Claude AI to begin interactive lessons
4. Track progress in `vocabulary.json` and `progress-notes.md`

## Note on Methodology

This system was designed based on:
- Research showing production and recognition are separate skills
- Evidence that pressure improves performance for certain learners
- Studies on L1 interference patterns for English speakers
- Metacognitive learning strategies
- Burnout prevention in intensive learning

Built for a 45-year-old software professional who thinks in systems, not phrases.
