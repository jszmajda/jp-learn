# Japanese Learning Progress Notes

## Session 7 Summary (2025-09-06)

**Focus**: Particle complexity and adjective conjugation patterns

**Key Insights Mastered**:
- が particle: conjunction "but" vs. subject marker (two different functions)
- Change patterns: い-adjectives (悪く + なる) vs. nouns (病気 + に + なる)
- Causal patterns: ので for "because" (い-adj + ので, noun + な + ので)
- な as conceptual applicator: bridges noun-concepts to following elements
- いい irregular conjugation: borrows from よい (よかった, よく)

**Current Strengths**:
- Strong pattern recognition abilities
- Good grasp of particle basics
- Comfortable with い-adjective conjugation
- Understanding of kanji radical patterns (気 family)

**Areas for Development**:
- Expanding vocabulary systematically
- Building toward JLPT level competencies
- More complex sentence structures
- Reading comprehension with authentic materials
